# [Scholar](https://scholar.vt.edu/portal) tab renamer

I got annoyed with always needing to think so hard about the mapping between
the names I know courses by, and the CRNs or 4-digit course numbers scholar
shows them as.
It's rather annoying when you're really busy getting work done and that poor
UI design breaks your flow.

Usage
-----

To rename a tab, just right click it and select `Edit Scholar Tab Name`.
![Edit Scholar Tab Name](edit.png)

To reset the tab back to its original name, just set it to an empty name.
